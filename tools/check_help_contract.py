"""Fail CI when a documentation-required UI surface has no resolvable help_id.

Third completeness gate next to ``check_authz_contract.py`` (every live v1
route must be declared) and ``check_i18n_guard.py`` (every user-facing string
must be a translation key): every UI surface that users can land on must have
help content, or an explicitly justified opt-out.

The gate introspects the real surfaces from the registries that already exist
in the code, derives the help_id each surface is expected to carry, and then
requires that id to resolve in *every* locale of the generated help index:

    surface type   enumerated from                        expected help_id
    ------------   ------------------------------------   -----------------------
    route          gui/src/router/index.js (``routes[]``)  ``route.meta.helpId``
    widget         frontend/src/widgets/*/index.ts         ``widget-<kebab type>``
    logic block    obs.logic.registry.BUILTIN_NODE_TYPES   ``NodeTypeDef.help_id``
    skin           <skins repo>/packages/skins/*/          ``skin-<kebab name>``

Routes carry their id explicitly because the Admin-GUI reads it at runtime
(``TopBar.vue`` renders the page-level help button from ``route.meta.helpId``),
so the field is live wiring rather than gate-only metadata. The other three
follow a convention: ``NodePalette.vue`` derives a block's help_id from its
node type the same way this gate does, and widgets and skins have no runtime
consumer for such a field yet.

Logic blocks that are ``hidden_from_palette`` are excluded by rule, not by
allowlist: the palette is the only place a user can pick a block from, so a
block it never offers is not a surface anyone can land on (today those are the
two legacy notification blocks).

The scans read JavaScript textually, and where that cannot be done with
confidence they **fail closed** rather than skip: a route whose ``name``, a
``children`` array, or a widget registration's ``type`` is not something the
scan can resolve to a literal aborts the run with the file and line. Silently
passing over such a declaration is the one outcome a coverage gate must never
produce — the surface ships, and the gate reports success.

On top of coverage the gate closes the resolvability hole the help generator
leaves open: every help_id literally referenced from GUI/Visu sources must
exist, and — unlike ``generate-help-index.mjs``, which only warns — a help_id
missing in one locale fails the build.

Deliberately undocumented surfaces belong in ``tools/help-contract-allowlist.txt``
with a reason, mirroring ``tools/i18n-allowlist.txt``. The allowlist is checked
back against reality: an entry for a surface that no longer exists, or for one
that meanwhile *is* documented, fails too, so the list cannot rot into a
blanket exemption.

Usage:
    python tools/check_help_contract.py [--skins-dir PATH]

The skins live in the separate ``obs-visu-skins`` repository. Without
``--skins-dir`` (or ``OBS_VISU_SKINS_DIR``) that surface is reported as not
checked instead of silently passing.
