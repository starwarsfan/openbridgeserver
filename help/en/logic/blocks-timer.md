# Blocks: Timer

Time-triggered blocks, delays, counters, and sequences.

## Trigger {#logic-block-timer-cron}

Fires automatically on a cron schedule (minute hour day month weekday). Configuration offers
three interlinked levels:

- **Preset schedules** — common patterns like "Every 5 minutes", "Daily at 07:00", or "Weekdays
  (Mon–Fri) at 06:00" via dropdown.
- **Customize schedule** — a visual editor with one input field per cron field (minute, hour, day,
  month, weekday; `0`=Sunday). Supports `*` (every), `*/5` (every 5), ranges (`1-5`), and lists
  (`1,3`).
- **Expression** — the raw cron expression, directly editable, with a link to crontab.guru for
  looking up more complex patterns.

All three levels stay in sync — a change at any level updates the others.

The schedule is evaluated in the configured application timezone (**Settings → General**), not
UTC — a "Daily at 07:00" trigger fires at 7am local time and follows daylight-saving transitions.

## Date/Time {#logic-block-datetime}

Outputs the current date and time in the configured application timezone (**Date**, **Time**,
**Custom** outputs). The custom format uses the same formatting tokens as **Settings → General**
(`d`/`dd`, `EE`/`EEE`/`EEEE`, `M`/`MM`/`MMM`/`MMMM`, `yy`/`yyyy`, `H`/`HH`, `m`/`mm`, `s`/`ss`).

## Delay {#logic-block-timer-delay}

Delays a trigger signal by a configured number of seconds before it appears at the output.

## Tick {#logic-block-timer-pulse}

Automatically fires a trigger pulse every configured **interval** seconds — no input, runs on
its own in the background. Useful for triggering sub-minute cadences a cron schedule
(minute-granularity) is too coarse for, e.g. a smoothly changing light.

## Operating Hours {#logic-block-operating-hours}

Counts operating hours while the **Active** input is true. The **Reset** input resets the counter
to zero. "Restore state after restart" determines whether the counter value survives a server
restart.

## Sequence {#logic-block-value-sequence}

Writes a series of values with configurable pauses in between — e.g. for blink or process control
sequences. Each **step** defines a target object (empty = a pure pause, no write), the value to
write, and the wait time (ms) until the next step; steps can be reordered, duplicated, and removed
via arrow buttons — "Blink preset" sets up a ready-made on/off sequence.

- **Run mode** — Once, a fixed number of repetitions, or as long as the **Condition** input is
  true.
- **On new trigger** — what happens if triggered again while a sequence is already running:
  Ignore, Restart (from the beginning), or Queue (append after the current one finishes).
- **Cancel when condition becomes false** — only for "as long as condition is true": cancels a
  running sequence immediately once the condition is no longer met.

## Sensor Watchdog {#logic-block-timer-sensor-watchdog}

Monitors up to 10 inputs for missing new telegrams. Each input has its own **Timeout** (seconds),
**Fault Value**, optional display name, and optional **Repeat** (seconds). While an input keeps
receiving telegrams regularly, its value is passed through unchanged to the corresponding output;
once no new telegram has arrived for longer than the configured timeout, that output switches to
the Fault Value instead — until a telegram arrives again.

**Important when wiring this up:** both **Value** and **Changed** from the upstream Read Object
block must be connected for each input. Only a genuine new telegram (Changed = true) resets the
timeout — a value re-sent unchanged still counts as a sign of life (important for e.g. contact
sensors whose value can stay the same for a long time while still actively sending). A mere
re-evaluation of the graph (triggered by an unrelated event, or by this block's own periodic
scheduler) does **not** count as a sign of life. If only **Value** is connected, that input reports
one fault after the first timeout and never recovers afterwards — this is not a bug, it is the
intended fail-stale behavior for a missing Changed connection.

The block runs its own internal periodic scheduler and detects an elapsed timeout even when
nothing else happens anywhere else in the graph — unlike a hand-built replacement out of
Delay/Pulse blocks, which only react to a new trigger signal and cannot "wake themselves up".

The moment an input newly transitions into the fault state, **Fault Text** outputs a message like
"No data from &lt;Name&gt;" and **Fault Trigger** fires a pulse — e.g. to drive a notification. With
**Repeat** left at 0 (default) this happens only once, on the initial fault; with a value greater
than 0, the trigger additionally fires again at that interval for as long as the input keeps being
stale — e.g. check every 10s, but only re-notify hourly. When an input recovers (a new telegram
arrives), no further trigger fires, and the repeat interval starts over the next time it goes
stale.
