# Hierarchy

The Hierarchy tab lives in the Admin GUI under **Settings → Hierarchy**.

## Hierarchies {#settings-hierarchy}

Represents a tree-shaped structure (buildings, rooms, trades, topology, …) that data points
can be assigned to — it's used both for navigation/grouping in the GUI and as the basis for
scope assignment in the rights editor (see Settings → Users).

Multiple hierarchies can exist in parallel; each has its own mode:

- **Topology** — follows the KNX group address structure.
- **Building structure** — spatial layout, usually imported from an ETS project.
- **Trades → function** — grouped by trade.

**Import from ETS** — automatically generates a hierarchy from an ETS project's spatial or
functional structure (building/trades mode); data points can optionally be auto-linked to the
matching nodes via their group address. The same import is also available directly from the
KNX project import in the Data Management tab.

Nodes can be manually renamed, added, and deleted again (deleting a branch also removes all
its child nodes). The "display start level" determines from which level the shortened path is
shown in data point lists — the full path always remains visible as a tooltip.

A number in parentheses after a hierarchy's or node's name shows how many child elements sit
directly underneath it (e.g. "Shading (2)") — omitted for elements with no children. This
always counts direct children only, not the cumulative count across all deeper levels.

## Assigning Logic graphs

The same hierarchies can also be used to group Logic graphs — a graph can be sorted into
several independent hierarchies at once (e.g. a technical grouping by
shading/lighting/sockets alongside a topological one by room). This assignment is purely
organizational and has no effect on permissions — Logic graphs keep their own, independent
permission model.

This page manages only the hierarchies themselves (trees and nodes); assigning a Logic graph
to a hierarchy position happens entirely in the Logic editor, via its "Open Logic" picker
(Logic module → toolbar).
