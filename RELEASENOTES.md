# Changes
## 2026.8.0
### Breaking changes 🚨
* Monitor/RingBuffer: Storage is now automatically **segmented** instead of a single ever-growing SQLite file. On upgrade the existing ring-buffer database is attached **read-only** and new events are written to time-based segments (~6 h each). Retention is now **segment-granular** and enforced against the hard `max_file_size_bytes` budget: to protect disk space, whole old segments — including the pre-upgrade data — may be dropped **earlier than the configured age target** once the size budget is exceeded, so monitor history can be lost sooner than before. Operators who need to keep more history should raise the size/retention limits in the Monitor configuration promptly after upgrading, at the cost of higher disk usage. The fresh-install default for `max_file_size_bytes` has been raised from 10 MiB to **100 MiB** (existing installations are unchanged — only new-install defaults are affected). https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/919
* Monitor/RingBuffer: New **legacy migration assistant** for upgraded installations. When a pre-segmentation ring-buffer database is detected, the old history is now protected from FIFO retention until an admin makes an informed decision. A one-time wizard (Monitor view, dashboard card, and segment-status dialog) explains the options and their consequences: **migrate** the newest old events into segments (budget-bounded offline copy that runs alongside live recording; the write pause is limited to a sub-second atomic commit), **keep** the old database read-only until the size budget reclaims it as a whole, or **discard** it immediately. The assistant previews sizes, time spans, disk-space checks, and a data-driven forecast of when the budget would force reclamation. **Breaking/limitation:** the migration copy is bounded by `max_file_size_bytes` – if the budget is smaller than the converted history, the oldest events are dropped during migration (the wizard shows how many). Segmented storage needs roughly **2 × the size of the old ring-buffer database** (typed value columns and metadata indexes; measured ~1.4× for metadata-rich events up to ~4× for very small ones). To migrate without loss, raise the budget to at least `2 × old database size` first; afterwards prefer reducing retention via an age limit instead of shrinking the budget, which would immediately trim the oldest segments again. Until a decision is made the old history is protected from retention, but live recording remains bound by the configured budget – with a small budget, adjust it promptly – and migrate promptly after raising the budget, since live recording grows into the new budget and displaces old events from the migration copy one-for-one. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/964 https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/965 https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/966

### New features ✨
* Adapter: 1-Wire adapter rewritten as an `owserver`/OWFS client via `pyownet`, so USB busmasters (including the ElabNET PBM) and native kernel buses all work through one code path. Adds sensor/property browsing with inline ROM-ID → label aliasing from the binding form, and writable 1-Wire properties (e.g. DS2408 switches) now actually write instead of being a no-op. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/6
* Adapter/Modbus TCP: New shared_bus option serialises I/O across all Modbus-TCP adapter instances that poll the same host:port, so multiple devices behind one RS485/Modbus-TCP gateway (different unit ids) no longer issue overlapping requests on the shared serial bus. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/1045
* Admin GUI: `.knxproj` imports now offer hierarchy creation for topology, buildings/rooms, and trades in the same import flow, including per-hierarchy result feedback and optional auto-linking to created objects. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/729
* Admin GUI/Visu: The configuration column in the Logic editor and the Visu page editor is now dragable in width via a handle on its left edge, so long object names stay readable on widescreen monitors; the chosen width is remembered per browser. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/1034
* Backend: ETS hierarchy import logic is now available as a reusable backend service while keeping `POST /api/v1/hierarchy/import-from-ets` behavior unchanged. This prepares the KNX project import to create selected ETS hierarchies in the same import flow. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/727
* Backend: `.knxproj` imports can now create selected ETS hierarchies in the same backend request, reporting per-hierarchy node/link counts and non-fatal failures for unavailable ETS data. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/728
* Backend/Admin GUI: Repeated `.knxproj` imports now replace automatically generated ETS hierarchies per selected mode by default, while manual hierarchy trees remain untouched; the import dialog also offers an opt-out to keep a separate tree for each import run. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/730
* Backend/Admin GUI/Logic Engine: Date and time display formats can now be configured independently of language and timezone. MESSAGE templates support `###DATE###` and `###TIME###` alongside the backward-compatible ISO `###TS###`, and a new Date/Time logic block outputs the configured formats or a documented custom token format. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/1011
* Logic engine: Development of own logic blocks. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/446
* Logic Engine/Admin GUI: Added a Comment node — a freely placeable, purely visual note with multi-line text for documenting non-obvious graph logic directly on the canvas, with no effect on execution. Text renders inline in the node body and the node is resizable. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/1043
* Logic Engine/Admin GUI: Added a generic Notification node that sends dynamic or fallback messages through one configured MESSAGE adapter to one or more Pushover, seven.io, Telegram, or other registered provider targets. Provider credentials and recipients remain centrally configured in the adapter; the legacy Pushover and seven.io nodes remain executable and editable for existing logic sheets but are hidden from the palette for new nodes. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/916
* Logic Engine/Admin GUI: Added a Sequence node for state-triggered, non-blocking value-write and pause sequences. Sequences are configured with a visual step editor (including object picker, reordering, duplication, pauses and a blink preset), configurable repeat/restart policies, and normal object values such as colours, switches or dimmer levels. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/1021
* Logic Engine/Admin GUI: Debug mode now opens a dedicated block inspector with complete scrollable/copyable inputs and outputs, structured JSON formatting, value type/size and execution metadata. Individual inputs can be overridden for one-off test executions without changing upstream blocks or saved logic; all debug data and overrides are discarded when debug mode is disabled, and live payloads are only prepared for subscribed debug sessions. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/1032
* Logic Engine/Admin GUI: Function blocks can now optionally snap their upper-left corner to the visible points of a configurable 5–100 px grid in the logic editor; the enabled state and grid size are remembered per browser. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/1003
* Logic Engine/Admin GUI: The maximum iCalendar download size is now configurable per function block from 1–50 MiB. The default has been raised from 1 MiB to 2 MiB, allowing larger long-running calendars while retaining the streamed download-size guard. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/1005
* Logic Engine/Admin GUI: Selected function blocks in the logic editor can now be copied and pasted, including onto a different logic sheet, preserving their configuration and the connections between them; pasted blocks land pre-selected and slightly offset so they can be dragged into place immediately. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/1084
* Visu: The page editor now supports selecting multiple widgets at once — Shift/Ctrl+click toggles individual widgets, dragging on empty canvas draws a selection box, and dragging any selected widget moves the whole selection together; Delete/Backspace removes all selected widgets. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/1036

### Fixes 🐞
* Monitor/RingBuffer: Recording no longer rescans the entire active SQLite segment after every event to recompute row count and timestamp bounds. Active segment statistics now advance incrementally after each committed append and are still rebuilt from disk during startup recovery, eliminating the resulting sustained CPU and page-cache read amplification on large or high-rate installations. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/1097
* Backend/KNX: `BOTH`-direction bindings now recognize and individually consume their own short-lived command and state-address confirmations by binding and raw payload, including confirmations from rapid consecutive writes and XKNX automatic reconnect retries. Repeated or coalesced state-address feedback for identical encoded payloads restores the newest logical command, while command-address callbacks remain ordered. Queued-write context is retained until XKNX reports successful transmission and across unchanged binding reloads; failed queue submissions and context for changed or removed bindings are cleaned automatically. Command and state-address confirmations bypass further binding propagation across every binding sharing the address. Confirmations restore the pre-transformation logical value to persisted/UI state, while commands that already emitted an event avoid retriggering logic, notification, and presence actions; direct commands without an initial event make exactly one confirmation actionable. Locally generated responses to KNX read requests are ignored by the inbound value path. This prevents non-idempotent `value_formula` transformations from creating runaway feedback loops while leaving unrelated bindings and later genuine value changes unaffected. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/910
* Monitor/RingBuffer: Pinned but switched-off filter sets no longer produce an empty initial or refreshed table while live events follow different filtering rules. Only pinned and enabled sets participate consistently in loading, refresh, CSV/TSV export, and live updates; switching off the last participating set restores the unfiltered monitor view. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/1062
* Backend/KNX: ETS hierarchy imports in `groups`, `mid`, and `flat` mode now automatically link uniquely matching KNX data points, including feedback/state group addresses. Missing or ambiguous matches remain unlinked. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/1060
* Monitor/RingBuffer: Adapter-only filter sets now match the telegram source consistently across historical and live entries even when adapter type identifiers use registry-style uppercase or legacy/internal lowercase casing. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/1077
* Monitor/RingBuffer: After a partial legacy migration started from “keep”, remaining legacy sources stay protected across process restarts even when the post-commit application-database update temporarily fails. The migration commit now records a durable repair marker before startup retention can reclaim the remaining source, while later explicit “keep” decisions remain unchanged. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/1013
* Monitor/RingBuffer: Restored or copied installations no longer treat an attached legacy ring-buffer database as already migrated merely because the application database contains a stale terminal migration marker. The server reopens the decision, protects the legacy source from retention, keeps it visible and actionable in the dashboard and migration assistant without requiring a restart, and reports a valid empty legacy database as exactly zero rows instead of hiding it behind a completed state. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/1050
* Monitor/RingBuffer: Empty hierarchy filters now match no entries instead of widening the query to unrelated events. The legacy migration assistant now anticipates stale copy-phase cleanup only when the next migration can actually reach it, preserves all chunks while a migration, interrupted-commit recovery, or quarantined source blocks cleanup, and credits free disk only for existing main segment files. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/1009 https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/1061
* Monitor/RingBuffer: Segment rotation no longer falls back to an unexplained fixed 256 MiB size cap. Each segment threshold is now either explicit, derived as one third of its matching total retention limit, or disabled; configurations without any effective rotation trigger are rejected. The Admin UI shows the effective source per dimension, warns and asks for confirmation when total retention is unbounded, and forecasts disk growth for that case. A 30-day retention with explicit 24-hour segments and no disk budget therefore rotates by age without an implicit size cap. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/919
* Logic/History: Consumption counters now reset daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly values in the configured application timezone. SQLite history aggregate buckets now carry explicit UTC (`Z`) timestamps, and the Chart widget continues to interpret legacy timezone-less buckets as UTC. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/975 https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/909
* Logic Engine/Admin GUI: Delay and Pulse function blocks no longer accept negative time values. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/1002
* Logic Engine: Event-driven logic executions now trigger notification blocks only on the branch downstream of the changed object. Cached values on unrelated branches no longer resend previous messages to other MESSAGE targets or providers; manual whole-sheet execution remains unchanged. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/1090
* Logic Engine: Read Object blocks now load the current object value when a logic sheet is saved, activated, imported (single sheet or configuration restore), or duplicated, so downstream logic starts with the latest known state immediately instead of waiting for the next object update. The initialization pass is side-effect-free: it only writes objects on paths carrying a seeded value and does not fire notifications, HTTP requests, or other trigger-driven actions. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/1031
* Logic engine: JSON Extractor path selection now assigns the chosen path to the selected output instead of incorrectly overwriting the last output. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/980
* KNX: Added the reactive-energy datapoint types DPT 13.012 (VARh) and DPT 13.015 (kVARh) to the DPT registry. Bindings configured with these DPTs previously fell back to the UNKNOWN definition and produced no decoded value. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/1030
* Visu: Chart widget — the primary series (bound via the widget's own top-level datapoint) always reused the widget's own title as its legend label, with no way to give it a distinct name independent of the title. This was easy to miss with only one extra series, but became visibly confusing with two or more — e.g. a 3-phase grid-voltage history chart where the extra series correctly showed "L2"/"L3" while the primary series showed the full chart title instead of "L1". A new optional `primary_label` config field lets it be set independently; existing Chart widgets keep their current behavior unchanged when left unset. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/1114

## 2026.7.0
### Breaking changes 🚨
* Security: `GET /api/v1/weather/fetch` now requires authenticated access and no longer accepts tokens in the URL query string. Weather widgets on PIN-protected Visu pages continue to work with their page-scoped session token, but unauthenticated public weather proxy calls are rejected; private/local weather endpoints still require an explicit URL Target Allowlist entry. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/791

### New features ✨
* Adapter: New MESSAGE notification adapter sends messages on data point value changes with configurable conditions, `any` matching, cooldowns, templates, and targets. Supported providers are Pushover, Telegram, and seven.io SMS/Voice; Signal is intentionally not included for now because it would require a separate gateway service. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/882
* Backend/Admin GUI/Visu: Added message archives for durable notification and event records, including archive management, retention, integrity checks, import/export APIs, filtered entry lists with read/acknowledge state, a Visu MessageArchive widget with page-scoped live updates, MESSAGE adapter archive strategies, and logic nodes that can write archive entries and trigger downstream flows. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/918
* Backend/Admin GUI: OBS internal datapoints without adapter bindings can now be written through the object detail view; the write is stored as the current value and propagated through the normal registry, retained MQTT value, history/ringbuffer, WebSocket, and logic event path. MQTT `dp/{uuid}/set` writes to bindingless internal datapoints are intentionally ignored unless the datapoint has an explicit writable adapter binding. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/715
* Backend/Admin GUI: ETS hierarchy import logic is now available as a reusable backend service while keeping `POST /api/v1/hierarchy/import-from-ets` behavior unchanged. This prepares the KNX project import to create selected ETS hierarchies in the same import flow. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/727
* Backend/Admin GUI: `.knxproj` imports can now create selected ETS hierarchies in the same backend request, reporting per-hierarchy node/link counts and non-fatal failures for unavailable ETS data. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/728
* Backend/Admin GUI: Repeated `.knxproj` imports now replace automatically generated ETS hierarchies per selected mode by default, while manual hierarchy trees remain untouched; the import dialog also offers an opt-out to keep a separate tree for each import run. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/730
* Backend/Admin GUI: Added a dedicated KNX devices page for imported `.knxproj` devices, including sidebar navigation, hierarchy assignment/filtering, a direct import entry point, and a Monitor/RingBuffer KNX device filter that can expand a device into its datapoint bindings. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/911
* Visu: Stufenschalter now supports configurable operation modes for sequence cycling, selection with save, and direct selection while remaining compatible with existing step configurations. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/716
* Backend/Admin GUI: Added offline `obs-admin` CLI for support scenarios without a running OBS HTTP server. It can resolve the configuration database path, list and enable/disable adapter instances and bindings, create SQLite backups, persist the next-start log level, validate JSON config fields, and create sanitized offline support packages. Docker and LXC builds install the command directly; existing LXC containers upgrading from a release without `obs-admin` can run `/opt/obs/obs-admin` or install it once into `/usr/local/bin`. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/863
* Backend/Admin GUI: The Monitor/RingBuffer can now be disabled to avoid runtime recording overhead; disabling it warns the user and deletes existing monitor entries to free storage. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/859
* Backend/Admin GUI: `.knxproj` imports now offer hierarchy creation for topology, buildings/rooms, and trades in the same import flow, including per-hierarchy result feedback and optional auto-linking to created objects. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/729
* Backend/Admin GUI: Logic editor block palette — individual block sections (Logic, Objects, Math, …) can now be collapsed and expanded by clicking the section header; the entire palette column can also be collapsed to a slim rail and restored the same way. Both states persist across page reloads. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/875
* Backend/Admin GUI: The minimap in the logic editor can now be dragged to any position within the canvas; the position is saved and restored across page reloads. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/879
* Logic Engine/Admin GUI: New Wake-on-LAN node sends a UDP broadcast magic packet to wake a device when the trigger input is true; MAC address, broadcast IP, and port are configurable with inline format validation. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/825
* Logic Engine/Admin GUI: New Host Check node pings a host on each trigger pulse (rising-edge, cron-friendly) and outputs reachability (true/false) and round-trip latency in milliseconds. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/872
* Logic Engine/Admin GUI: New Memory node provides an explicit tick boundary for controlled feedback loops. Direct graph cycles are validated in the editor/API and blocked when connecting or saving, while feedback through Memory uses the previous run's stored value and persists state across restarts. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/789
* Logic Engine/Admin GUI: New Decision and Mapping function blocks share a reusable condition engine. Decision evaluates independent boolean outputs in parallel; Mapping evaluates ordered rules and returns the first matching typed result with an optional default value. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/891
* Logic: HTTP API nodes can now define object-backed variables (`OBS1`, `OBS2`, …) and use placeholders like `###OBS1###` in URLs, headers, authentication fields and request bodies. Values are read immediately before the request; missing variables or objects without values stop the request with an explicit error. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/817
* Release: LXC template and app-bundle checksums now use SHA-256 instead of SHA-512; release notes include a `Checksums (SHA-256)` section and Proxmox download instructions are updated accordingly. Existing installations are unaffected — the new `obs-update` falls back to legacy SHA-512 assets for rollback targets, and a transitional SHA-512 asset is still published alongside SHA-256 so pre-migration updaters can bootstrap the switch. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/831
* Release: `obs-update` now accepts a `--nightly` / `-n` flag; when passed, nightly builds (`nightly-YYYYMMDD` tags) appear in the interactive version picker alongside RCs and stable releases, sorted semantically by date and labelled distinctly as `(nightly)`. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/939
* Visu: Licht widget: the EIN/AUS state label can now be hidden via "show_state_text". https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/840
* Visu: Link widget now supports hiding the icon via the "show_icon" option. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/839
* Visu: Editor grid limits extended — columns up to 120, cell size down to 10 px, enabling fullscreen/dense layouts. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/842
* Visu: Link and ButtonGroup widgets now support "preserve_icon_color" per widget/button — when enabled, SVG icons retain their original colors instead of being forced to black/white. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/845
* Visu: Widget frames now support visual variants — "flat" (no background), "outline" (border only), or default (gray card). Configurable per widget in the Visu editor. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/844
* Visu: Link and Toggle widgets: label font size is now configurable (xs/sm/md/lg/xl). https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/841
* Visu: Link widget: active page can now be highlighted automatically — choose between dot (●), bottom bar, or border indicator, with hierarchical ancestor matching. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/843
* Visu: Link widget: the navigation arrow (→) can now be hidden independently of the icon via the "show_arrow" option (default: shown).

### Fixes 🐞
* Security (Upstream PR #956): bind legacy SHA-512 fallback verification to the app bundle filename.
* Security (Upstream PR #955): keep updater checksum notes compatible with legacy app-bundle verification.
* Security (Upstream PR #954): prevent API-client URL variables from changing request authority.
* Security (Upstream PR #953): redact MESSAGE provider credentials in adapter responses without overwriting stored secrets.
* Security (Upstream PR #952): prevent MQTT writes from mutating bindingless internal datapoints.
* QA/CI: The i18n hard gate now runs reliably with macOS Bash 3.2 when no explicit diff range is provided, avoiding local pre-push failures caused by empty Bash arrays. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/898
* Release: `obs-update` and `obs-admin` self-update steps now use atomic `install -m 755` instead of `cp + chmod`, preventing a self-overwrite race that could truncate the running script in-place. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/939
* Visu: Kamera widget — Basic Auth and API-Key credential fields are now always shown when the matching auth type is selected, including after loading a page saved with an older auth format. The config panel no longer renders blank when a widget with a null or missing config is selected. Legacy authType values stored as display text are normalised to canonical form on load. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/823
* Backend: KNX adapter no longer forwards non-finite float values (`inf`, `-inf`, `nan`) produced by DPT decoders to the event bus. Such values are now published with `quality=bad` and `value=null` instead of propagating to the InfluxDB history plugin, which rejected them with HTTP 400 "invalid boolean". https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/827
* Visu/Admin GUI: The Visu browser-tab favicon was missing; a web app manifest with icon metadata has been added to both frontends so that "Add to Home Screen" shortcuts on mobile devices receive the OBS icon. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/884
* Admin GUI/Visu: Missing translations no longer show `common.enabled` in the binding form, and the Info widget now renders the "additional values" heading instead of the raw `$t(...)` expression. The frontend i18n guard also catches raw translation calls left as template text. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/864
* Backend: KNX adapter no longer forwards non-finite float values (`inf`, `-inf`, `nan`) produced by DPT decoders to the event bus. Such values are now published with `quality=bad` and `value=null` instead of propagating to the InfluxDB history plugin, which rejected them with HTTP 400 "invalid boolean". https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/827
* Backend/Frontend: `value_map` transformations now match string keys case-insensitively after exact lookup, so values such as `OFF`, `oN`, `TRUE`, and `FALSE` work with built-in presets and custom maps. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/834
* Visu: Rolladen-Widget — Beschriftungen der Statusindikatoren 1–4 wurden als roher i18n-Key angezeigt statt als übersetzter Text (fehlende doppelte geschweifte Klammern in der Config-Komponente).
* Backend: High-volume third-party DEBUG loggers (e.g. `aiosqlite`, which logs two lines per SQL operation) are now floored at INFO, so enabling DEBUG globally no longer floods the logs and saturates a CPU core. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/798
* Backend: Logic-Executor verschluckt Node-Fehler still (result = {}) — kein sichtbares Feedback. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/788
* Logic Engine/Admin GUI: Cyclic logic graph nodes are no longer silently skipped. Runs now return explicit node diagnostics and warnings for direct cycles or nodes blocked by a cycle; the editor surfaces those diagnostics on affected nodes. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/789
* Visu: German string literals in backend adapter code reached the GUI untranslated, bypassing the i18n/Weblate pipeline. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/779
* Visu: Zeitschaltuhr widgets now only show and manage Schaltpunkte for the configured scheduler instance, preventing unrelated KNX or other adapter bindings on the same object from being listed or deleted. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/782
* Visu: Kamera widget — Basic Auth and API-Key credential fields are now always shown when the matching auth type is selected, including after loading a page saved with an older auth format. The config panel no longer renders blank when a widget with a null or missing config is selected. Legacy authType values stored as display text are normalised to canonical form on load. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/823
* Visu/Admin GUI: The Visu browser-tab favicon was missing; a web app manifest with icon metadata has been added to both frontends so that "Add to Home Screen" shortcuts on mobile devices receive the OBS icon. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/884
* Backend: The main database's write-ahead log (`obs.db-wal`) could grow without bound under continuous history writes and fill the disk, because the default PASSIVE auto-checkpoint never truncated the WAL file. The connection now bounds the WAL via `journal_size_limit`/`wal_autocheckpoint`, a periodic maintenance task forces a `wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)`, and the WAL is checkpointed once more on graceful shutdown. The support package (online API and offline `obs-admin` CLI) now also reports per-file on-disk sizes (`db`/`wal`/`shm`) for both the main and ringbuffer databases, so a WAL growing out of proportion to its DB is visible in diagnostics. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/908

### Fixes 🐞
* Packaging: New LXC container based on release 2026.6.0 not starting. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/808



## 2026.6.0
### Breaking changes 🚨
* Security: Backend URL fetches from logic API-client nodes, iCalendar nodes, Pushover `image_url` attachments, the camera proxy, and the weather API now block private/local network targets by default unless they are explicitly allowlisted. Migration: existing installations using LAN cameras such as `http://192.168.x.x/...`, local `.ics` calendars, local Pushover image sources, or a local weather endpoint must allowlist the target under Settings → Security → URL Target Allowlist, or in the YAML file configured by `security.url_target_allowlist_path` (default: `OBS_SECRET_FILE_DIR/url-target-allowlist.yaml` when `OBS_SECRET_FILE_DIR` is set, otherwise `secrets/url-target-allowlist.yaml` next to the configured database). Use an IP address or CIDR for private targets, for example `192.168.1.23/32` or `10.38.113.0/24`. If a hostname such as `internal.example` resolves to a private IP address, allowlist the resolved IP/CIDR; a hostname-only entry does not override private-IP blocking and does not bypass DNS validation. Until the target is allowlisted, affected camera widgets, weather widgets, iCalendar nodes, Pushover image attachments, or logic API-client calls are intentionally blocked. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/700
* Security: Support-package creation and temporary debug-log controls are now admin-only. The regular in-memory log API remains available to authenticated users and API keys, and live `log_entry` WebSocket messages follow the same authenticated read access. Generated support packages sanitize credentials, endpoints, IPs/domains, paths, and log details before export. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/737

### Fixes 🐞
* Backend: Hierarchy selections now respect the configured display start level consistently in dropdowns, chips, datapoint filters, and datapoint hierarchy assignments; deeper levels remain navigable while full paths stay available for disambiguation. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/717
* Adapter: Fixed Modbus TCP bindings stopping to poll after a binding is deleted and recreated (e.g. when changing scale_factor or data_format). Root cause: `t.cancel()` without `asyncio.gather()` allowed old and new poll tasks to read the shared TCP socket concurrently, corrupting the stream. Fix includes: (1) await gather() so old tasks finish before new ones start; (2) always close+reconnect after reload for a clean TCP session; (3) auto-reconnect with `_reconnect_lock` in the poll loop; (4) unified I/O semaphore `_io_sem` covering both reads *and* writes so DEST writes cannot interleave with SOURCE reads; (5) `disconnect()` also awaits gather() for consistency; (6) startup jitter applied only on initial connect, not on subsequent binding changes; (7) `None` sentinel instead of `sys.maxsize` for the unlimited mode; (8) bad quality published when `connect()` returns without error but `client.connected` stays False. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/714
* Adapter: Modbus TCP adapter now supports two new optional config fields: `serialize_reads` (bool, default `true`) serializes all in-flight reads via a semaphore — recommended for embedded devices that process only one request at a time; `startup_jitter_s` (float 0-300, default `30`) adds a random per-task delay before the first poll to prevent a thundering-herd burst when many bindings start simultaneously. Both options are configurable per adapter instance in the OBS UI. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/714
* Adapter: SNMP `_coerce_value` now routes `Counter64`, `Counter32`, and `Gauge32` through the `int` branch when `data_type="int"` is set explicitly, preventing these counter types from being stored as raw objects. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/707
* Adapter: KNX IP Secure now works correctly in Docker bridge networks — credentials are extracted directly from the .knxkeys file and passed explicitly to xknx, bypassing the internal UDP DescriptionRequest that fails without host networking. Connection errors now include actionable hints (Docker network mode, gateway tunnel-slot exhaustion). https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/393
* Adapter: KNX DPT10.001 (Time of Day) values are now decoded as Python `datetime.time` objects, matching the OBS `TIME` datapoint type. Persisted values are correctly restored on restart. JSON/WebSocket/MQTT/History boundaries serialize them as ISO strings; MQTT output bindings without payload template keep the backward-compatible raw payload form such as `10:30:00`. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/688
* Backend: Complete remaining UI translation fixes after i18n rollout. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/542
* Backend: Validate `DataValueEvent` payloads before bridge propagation. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/519
* Backend: Ringbuffer pause/resume race condition stabilized. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/509
* Backend: RingBuffer configuration changes that greatly reduce the maximum entry count no longer time out or pin a CPU core. Old monitor entries are trimmed in bounded batches, and existing RingBuffer metadata databases receive an `entry_id` index for efficient cascade deletes. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/856
* Backend: Monitor/RingBuffer now recovers automatically from a malformed SQLite database by quarantining the corrupted monitor DB/WAL/SHM files and recreating an empty RingBuffer, preventing repeated EventBus errors and Monitor API failures. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/689
* Backend: Monitor live updates now stay in sync when active filtersets are applied; WebSocket entries include RingBuffer metadata for tag matching and hierarchy-based filters trigger a server refresh instead of leaving the table stale. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/718
* Backend: InfluxDB v3 writes now use correct `db` query parameter. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/511
* Backend: The adapter page automatically reloaded every few seconds, making configuration difficult. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/394
* Backend: Fix view permissions of Demo User https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/471
* Backend: History default window changed from 24h to 7d and is now configurable via `history.default_window_hours` (Settings → Historie DB). https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/582
* Backend: KNX UF Iconset import — one-click import of all 940 KNX UF icons from ha-knx-uf-iconset directly into the icon library (prefix `kuf_`); re-import overwrites existing icons. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/677
* Backend: ETS import of password-protected .knxproj files now works correctly: Gewerke (trades) are parsed from the decrypted inner ZIP, ETS6 wrong-password errors ("Bad HMAC check") are properly reported as password errors, GA and location parsing run in parallel (non-blocking), frontend timeout raised to 300 s for large files, and error messages are fully localized via error codes. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/679
* Backend: Fixed MQTT binding edit/create dialog becoming blank when switching to write direction; adapter-type resolution and i18n handling in BindingForm were hardened. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/656
* Backend: BindingForm was split into smaller adapter-specific components, reducing future maintenance risk and noisy i18n diffs. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/657
* Backend: Settings → History DB no longer opens as an empty tab when the TimescaleDB DSN placeholder is rendered; the `@` in the PostgreSQL example is escaped for vue-i18n. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/690
* Backend: Missing i18n in several areas of the Admin GUI: all port and node labels in the Logic Engine node canvas are now fully translated and react to locale switching; the Hierarchy Manager dialog has been fully internationalised (all hardcoded German strings replaced). https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/668
* Backend: Settings → History DB no longer opens as an empty tab when the TimescaleDB DSN placeholder is rendered; the `@` in the PostgreSQL example is escaped for vue-i18n. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/690
* Backend: `PATCH /api/v1/datapoints/{id}` now correctly accepts a `value` field. The value is validated and coerced against the datapoint's `data_type` (incompatible types return 422); on success a `DataValueEvent` is published and the value is immediately readable. Explicit `"value": null` clears the stored value with `quality="uncertain"`. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/707
* Frontend: Adapter config form field labels and descriptions (Modbus TCP, SNMP, Zeitschaltuhr) are now fully i18n-translated via `SchemaForm`; the `adapterType` prop triggers locale lookups with fallback to backend schema strings. Two hardcoded German strings in the binding-migration feedback path were also replaced with `t()` calls.
* Frontend: Monitor filterset dialog now marks required fields and explains invalid value filters before saving. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/720 https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/723
* Logic engine: Fixed a threading race in `LogicManager` by iterating over stable snapshots of graph and cron-task caches while re-checking current graph state before execution or persistence, preventing repeated `dictionary changed size during iteration` errors and stale graph execution during concurrent updates. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/738
* Logic engine: The object selector now uses the entire available window space. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/345
* Logic engine: Compare nodes now honour UI-saved operator aliases (`gt`, `lt`, `eq`, `gte`, `lte`, `ne`), support the static `operand` value when the second input is not wired, and keep existing `result`/`out` edge handles compatible so downstream logic nodes receive compare results correctly. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/742
* Logic engine: Sommer/Winter (DIN) block now fills T1/T2/T3 slots correctly when sensors report at intervals that do not hit hours 7, 12, or 22 exactly (e.g. every 2 or 4 hours). "First-crossing" semantics: each slot is captured on the first measurement at or after its target hour, so daily_avg is always computed and heating mode switches reliably. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/548
* Logic engine: Functional Block "Sommer/Winter (DIN)" completely rewritten: measurement times corrected to DIN Mannheimer standard (T1 = 07:00, T2 = 14:00, T3 = 21:00); single configurable threshold temperature (default 14 °C) with hysteresis (default 2 °C) replaces separate summer/winter thresholds; heating decision based on daily average; debug ports T1/T2/T3 now persist their values after the daily average is computed; missing slots are automatically recovered from history after a server restart. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/665

* Security: Stop exposing WebSocket JWTs in URL query strings. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/518
* Security: Restore public/protected viewer bootstrap reads and WebSocket connectivity without forcing JWT, reconnect page-scoped WS sessions on context changes, include WidgetRef target datapoints in anonymous allowlists, restrict anonymous WS allowlists to explicit datapoint fields, and stop passing JWT/session credentials via WS query params. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/553
* Security (Upstream PR #570): restore authenticated WebSocket access via header/subprotocol/API-key auth while keeping URL token transport disabled.
* Security: Prevent logic formula sandbox escape via custom round helper. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/504

* Security (Upstream PR #528): harden AST sandboxing in the logic executor to prevent sandbox escapes.
* Security: Harden SVG icon import sanitization (obfuscated javascript href, deep nesting guard, stable `<svg>` serialization, blocked SMIL animation tags, and DOCTYPE rejection), make ZIP imports atomic on sanitize errors, preserve API-key flows across username changes, and allow imports for authenticated users. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/555
* Security: Harden LXC first-boot and release handling (per-container JWT secret, stricter env/tag handling). https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/455 https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/506 https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/512

* Security: Logic API-client nodes, iCalendar nodes, Pushover image attachments, camera proxy requests, and weather API requests now share an admin-managed URL target allowlist for deliberate access to internal destinations while keeping SSRF protection active. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/700
* Security (Upstream PR #686): API client secret-file paths are restricted to a configured secret directory with bounded regular-file reads.
* Test stability: Monitor/Ringbuffer E2E scenarios stabilized. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/494
* Visu: Internal API base URL usage fixed for E2E/runtime alignment. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/pull/484
* Visu: History widget now updates automatically when new values arrive via WebSocket. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/408
* Visu: WebSocket subscriptions now immediately receive the current registry values, so viewers show values again right after reconnects or page changes instead of waiting for the next adapter poll. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/749
* Visu: History widget now uses aggregated history buckets for multi-day ranges, so periods up to "last 90 days" remain complete and render efficiently instead of only showing the newest 24 hours. https://github.com/abeggled/openbridgeserver/issues/692
